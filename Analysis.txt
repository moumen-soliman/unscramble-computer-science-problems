1. Task0:O(1)

There are two read csv codes and two print statements in the codebase which does not depends on the input size so the 
Time Complexity of the algorithm is constant So the Big O for worst case is : O(1)

2. Task1:O(n)

There are two read csv codes and one for loop which depends on the input size n which has been called 2 times so for loop
complexity is O(2n) and the print statement. So the Overall Time Complexity for worst Case is O(n) 

3. Task2:O(n)

There are two read csv codes and one for loop which depends on the input size n which has been called 1 times so for loop
complexity is O(n) and the print statement. So the Overall Time Complexity for worst Case is O(n) 

4. Task3:O(n^2)

#readCSV the complexity is constant: O(1)
#function GetFixedFromCalls complexity is : O(n^2)
#function GetFixedToFixedCalls complexity is: O(n)
#sorted() complexity is : O(nlogn)
#print statements complexity is : O(1)

#Overall Worst Case time complexity is: O(n^2)

5. Task4:O(nlogn)

#readCSV the complexity is constant: O(1)
#function GetLists time complexity is: O(2n)
#function IdentifyTeleMarketNos time complexity is : O(n)
#sorted() complexity is : O(nlogn)
#print statements complexity is : O(1)

#Overall Worst Case time complexity is: O(nlogn)
